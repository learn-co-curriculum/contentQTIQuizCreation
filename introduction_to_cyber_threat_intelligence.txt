Quiz title: Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence

Title: Identifying Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and its role in cybersecurity
1. What is the primary goal of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)?
a) To prevent all cyber-attacks  
... Feedback: While preventing attacks is ideal, the primary goal of CTI is to gather and analyze intelligence about threats, not necessarily to prevent every single attack.  
*b) To collect, analyze, and disseminate information about potential cyber threats  
... Feedback: Correct! CTI focuses on understanding potential threats to improve cybersecurity measures.  
c) To create new cybersecurity tools  
... Feedback: Creating new tools is important for security, but CTI specifically involves collecting and analyzing threat data.  
d) To perform system maintenance  
... Feedback: System maintenance is important but is unrelated to the CTI process.  

2. Which of the following is NOT a source of cyber threat intelligence?
a) Security logs  
... Feedback: Security logs are a critical internal source of cyber threat intelligence.  
b) Threat feeds  
... Feedback: Threat feeds provide essential information about emerging threats and indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
*c) System user manuals  
... Feedback: Correct! User manuals provide information on system use, but they do not inform threat intelligence efforts.  
d) Open-source intelligence (OSINT)  
... Feedback: OSINT is a valuable source of publicly available threat intelligence data.  

Title: Identifying the primary objectives of CTI
3. Which of the following best describes one of the primary objectives of CTI?
a) To generate revenue through cyber security services  
... Feedback: While cybersecurity services can be profitable, this is not a core objective of CTI.  
*b) To enhance threat detection and improve incident response  
... Feedback: Correct! One of the primary objectives of CTI is to help organizations detect threats earlier and respond more effectively.  
c) To report threats to law enforcement agencies  
... Feedback: Reporting threats to law enforcement can be an outcome of CTI, but it is not a primary objective.  
d) To create a better marketing strategy for cybersecurity products  
... Feedback: Marketing strategies are not a goal of CTI.  

Title: Identifying attack surfaces
4.  `Santa` lives at the North Pole
... Feedback: CTI prioritizes relevant threats, informs risk management, and helps organizations defend against evolving threats. Ignoring potential risks would not be a recommended strategy.

Title: Identifying attack surface areas and security controls
5. Which of the following is a common attack surface for threat actors?
a) Financial reports  
... Feedback: Financial reports may contain valuable information, but they are not a typical attack surface.  
*b) Network infrastructure  
... Feedback: Correct! Network infrastructure, including routers and switches, is often targeted by threat actors.  
c) Corporate event calendars  
... Feedback: While event calendars contain sensitive information, they are not commonly targeted as an attack surface.  
d) Product marketing documents  
... Feedback: Product marketing documents are unlikely to be directly targeted by cyber threat actors.

Title: Identifying attack surface areas and security controls
6. Threat actors may exploit which of the following vulnerabilities?
[*] Unpatched software vulnerabilities  
... Feedback: Correct! Unpatched vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers.  
[*] Weak access controls  
... Feedback: Correct! Weak access controls can make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.  
[*] Misconfigurations in systems  
... Feedback: Correct! Misconfigurations leave systems open to attacks.  

Title: Identifying various sources of cyber threat intelligence data
7. Which of the following is an internal source of cyber threat intelligence?
a) Threat intelligence feeds  
... Feedback: Threat intelligence feeds are generally provided by third-party vendors and are considered external sources.  
*b) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems  
... Feedback: Correct! SIEM systems collect and analyze security logs, providing valuable internal threat intelligence.  
c) Industry reports  
... Feedback: Industry reports are typically external sources of cyber threat intelligence.  
d) Open-source intelligence (OSINT)  
... Feedback: OSINT is also an external source of intelligence data.  

Title: Identifying various sources of cyber threat intelligence data
8. What type of intelligence can organizations gather using OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)?
a) Data from internal system logs  
... Feedback: OSINT gathers information from publicly available sources, not internal system logs.  
*b) Data from publicly available websites and forums  
... Feedback: Correct! OSINT pulls data from open sources like websites and social media.  
c) Information from paid threat intelligence services  
... Feedback: Paid services are not part of OSINT.  
d) Internal threat analysis reports  
... Feedback: Internal reports are not considered OSINT.  

Title: Application of CTI in cybersecurity strategies
9. How does cyber threat intelligence improve an organization's incident response capabilities?
a) By automatically blocking all future threats  
... Feedback: CTI helps organizations anticipate and understand threats, but it cannot block all threats automatically.  
*b) By providing context and early warnings about potential attacks  
... Feedback: Correct! CTI enhances incident response by giving organizations context and advance warnings, helping them prepare.  
c) By eliminating the need for manual threat analysis  
... Feedback: Manual analysis remains important, although CTI automates some processes.  
d) By making security teams unnecessary  
... Feedback: Security teams are essential to implementing CTI effectively.
